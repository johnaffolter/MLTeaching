Teaching Machine Learning for Interns

Problem Statement Definition<br />
Solutions Architecture Considerations<br />
Terraform/CloudFormation – Building Environment and Pipeline à ModelOps<br />
Docker Containers<br />
SageMaker<br />
Ingesting Data<br />
Loading from S3- What data type does it sit in?<br />
Loading flat files<br />
Splitting Data – 70 training/20 validation/10 test<br />
Handling Missing Data and why each type? Why SMOTE?<br />
Handling unbalanced data – Why each type?<br />
Normalizing data – When and Why – How much do you normalize when building neural networks?<br />
Exploratory Analysis<br />
Correlation<br />
Analyzing Features<br />
ROC/AUC Analysis<br />
Feature Engineering – Data Engineering with Spark<br />
Feature Selection – How can we select automatically from our exploratory analysis?<br />
K-fold validation – Why do we use it? When not to?<br />
Model Iteration – How can you automate the iteration through different models? Ensemble models?<br />
Model Selection – What are some of the types? Random Forrest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, BERT, Linear/Logistic Regression, LDA, PCA, SVM, What is the pros/cons of each model? <br />
Hyper-parameter tuning – Which Hyperparameters do what?<br />
Model Analysis- SHAP, Confusion Matrix<br />
Model Interpretation- How can you interpret something like a decision tree?<br />
Uplift Modeling – What are some examples? How would you take action on the results?<br />
Feedback loops à ModelOps<br />
