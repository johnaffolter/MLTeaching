Teaching Machine Learning for Interns

Problem Statement Definition
Solutions Architecture Considerations
Terraform/CloudFormation – Building Environment and Pipeline à ModelOps
Docker Containers
SageMaker
Ingesting Data
Loading from S3- What data type does it sit in?
Loading flat files
Splitting Data – 70 training/20 validation/10 test
Handling Missing Data and why each type? Why SMOTE?
Handling unbalanced data – Why each type?
Normalizing data – When and Why – How much do you normalize when building neural networks?
Exploratory Analysis
Correlation
Analyzing Features
ROC/AUC Analysis
Feature Engineering – Data Engineering with Spark
Feature Selection – How can we select automatically from our exploratory analysis?
K-fold validation – Why do we use it? When not to?
Model Iteration – How can you automate the iteration through different models? Ensemble models?
Model Selection – What are some of the types? Random Forrest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, BERT, Linear/Logistic Regression, LDA, PCA, SVM, What is the pros/cons of each model? 
Hyper-parameter tuning – Which Hyperparameters do what?
Model Analysis- SHAP, Confusion Matrix
Model Interpretation- How can you interpret something like a decision tree?
Uplift Modeling – What are some examples? How would you take action on the results?
Feedback loops à ModelOps
